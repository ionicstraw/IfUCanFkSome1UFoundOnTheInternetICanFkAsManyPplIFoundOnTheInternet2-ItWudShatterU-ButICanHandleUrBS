This playlist you have going on, I figured this out the other night, last night actually. It’s all aspirational, it's always been like that – it’s not really you being serious – it’s what you want to happen but you’re not going to do anything about it.

My spin cycle instructor like a decade ago once said, “men mature when they turn 40+” yeah I think you have another 20 yrs before you do

What's going to happen ... how are we going to meet again, im going to come to you in new york AGAIN, you're not going to come to me, you're going to sit there in your chair or whatever, and it's me making the trip to new york. you wont have to do anything AGAIN, that's bullshit over and over again.
